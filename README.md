Generic API_Deobfuscation temporary repository.

As part of the submission, we would like to share the executable files, experiment files, and results for review purposes. We believe that providing access to these materials will enhance the evaluation process and enable a better understanding of the work presented in the paper.

To facilitate the review, we have prepared the following items for submission:

Executable Files, Experiment Files, Results

It is important to note that at this stage, we are sharing the executable files, experiment files, and results only. Upon acceptance of the paper, we are committed to fully disclosing the original source code. We believe that sharing the source code after acceptance will provide the research community with a deeper understanding of the underlying implementation and enable further exploration and collaboration.

Thank you for considering our submission and for your attention to this matter. We are eagerly looking forward to the opportunity to present our work.
